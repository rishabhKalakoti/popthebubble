<p>Purvadhanashree has worked for a decade in promoting a rare classical dance of Telegu devdasis, vilasini Natyam which was performed in temples and royal courts.<br>
Vilasini Natyam was traditionally performed in the temples as a ritual, in the royal courts for the aesthetic pleasure of royalty and the general public as a form of infotainment. As all the Devadasi dance forms went through the renaissance period, this art also went through an awkward stage of rejection, doubt, and criticism. Social, political, religious and artistic reasons did not allow this art to thrive and it went into oblivion for several decades till Guru Swapnasundari worked towards bringing it back.

It is very aptly said that the purpose of life is to live a life of purpose. This justifies the success journey of Mr. Anubhav Dubey, co-founder of Chai Sutta Bar, a leading food venture with over 15 outlets and still expanding. Anubhav is a social entrepreneur and works towards the welfare of orphans by providing them mainly with employment and indirectly with a family with whom they work.<br>
 At the young age of 22, Anubhav Dubey, with his college friends, Anand Nayak, and  Rahul Gothi came up with an ordinary idea with the extraordinary potential to enter the market with their meager budget socially and environment-friendly start-up CSB.
The team of chai sutta bar purposely includes orphans to improve their financial stability and also the lifestyle. Their primary emphasis is to employ orphans who are capable of handling the work. <br>
 Their serving style is considerably different from that of the others. The setup also focusses on hygiene and environment issues and promotes the use of “Kulhads”(earthen cups) instead of plastic cups, thus generating a pollution free environment, and as they are used only once, they are very hygienic. The high amount of usage of Kulhads by Chai Sutta Bar has also increased the employment ratio of the kulhad artisans.
 Earlier, they had only seasonal employment that is at the time of Diwali. But now have got the opportunity of earning regularly. CSB had helped them fight with the struggle of sending their kids to school and have made their condition betters.<br>
 Anubhav Dubey has bagged various awards for young entrepreneurs and is currently preparing for UPSC along with managing his business to extend his devotion towards the welfare of the society at a much authoritative position. He was invited to the i5 summit organized as a joint venture by IIT-IIM Indore twice.<br>
He has successfully popped the bubble of the myth that there is an age of specific things especially when they are for the goodwill of the society. He has achieved great heights at such a young age. The country is in great need of such youth at this time.
